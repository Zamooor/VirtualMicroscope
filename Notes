Notes from Meeting on 11/15/2013 : 

1. One of our main goals that we talked about for the first prototype is to convert
    to canvas by using QCanvas, such as using operation with QDials, and Animated Dials.
    We will be removing openGl operations.
2. Link a Gui item to the interface using Callback in PyQt? 
   For Zoom we discussed how the change or click event is made, like value added for zoom functions.
3. Our goal for Friday is to get a prototype such that we can have out client do trial runs and provide feedback
    make the test fun, and seem interactive, might be nice to add more graphics to the results page etc. 
4. We can then later work on instant feedback. But this will be after we get one case that is working fine. 
5. 1st Phase, create a simple application [ Coordinate Graphics into the answer]
6. We also have 20 min presentations during dead\finals week.
